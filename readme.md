## Welcome to Learning MIPS Assembly Language Programming

# Prerequisites

- MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) installed on your machine. You can download it from the [here](MIPS_Jar/Mars4_5.jar)
- JDK installed on your system. You can download it from the [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)

To initialize the environment and run programs, follow these steps:

1. Download MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) jar file from the link provided above. Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to run the MARS jar file

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the MARS jar file

3. Run the following command to execute the MARS jar file:

```bash
java -jar Mars4_5.jar
```

4. If you are using Windows, you can simply double click on the MARS jar file to launch the application

5. Clone or download this repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking on the "Code" button on the repository's GitHub page and selecting the appropriate option

6. Open MARS and go to the "File" menu. Select "Open" and navigate to the location where you cloned or downloaded this repository. Open the desired assembly language program file (with a .asm extension) that you want to run

7. Follow the [runGuide.pdf](runGuide.pdf) for more information related to running your first program

7. Review the program code and make any necessary modifications or additions if you want

8. You can interact with the program by using the MARS simulator's console and registers window. Monitor the output and observe the program's behavior

Feel free to explore the repository and experiment with different MIPS assembly language programs. Happy coding!
